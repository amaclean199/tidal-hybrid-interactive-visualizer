# Tidal Hybrid Visualizer

A controllable audio visualizer with input from a webcam.

Music was created by first recording some snippets with [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), then bringing them into Pro Tools for additional production work.

Visuals were created with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Build and run

```npm run-script build```
```np start```

## Credits
